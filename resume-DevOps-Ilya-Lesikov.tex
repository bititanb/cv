% ABOUT

\subsection*{About}
\Delimitline

\forceindent I'm an experienced Automation Engineer/DevOps/SRE, who loves development, but still has a strong Linux SysAdmin background.

\forceindent I solve problems and make things easy (not simple). No reinventing the wheel. No overcomplicating. I know the balance between doing it right and quickly. Generally ``doing it right > quickly" though. My code is clean, maintainable and extensible, autotested and documented.

\forceindent I'm \sout{a nice guy} a good man. Easy to work with. If you care about me I care about you. Strong, balanced, informed. Funny (lie). I never lie.

\forceindent I look for: good, strong people, professional/career advancement, trust and no micromanagement, balance and common sense.

\forceindent I speak English (it's Advanced/C1 at least) and Russian (native).

\subsection*{GitHub}

\forceindent For the purposes of learning and demonstration of what I can do I recently did a demo of a pretty complete, fully-featured CI/CD and cloud automation for microservices. Done with Terraform, GCP, GKE/Kubernetes, GCB, ArgoCD, Stackdriver:\vspace{0.2em}\\

    \forceindent I did a fully-featured cloud automation and CI/CD done with Terraform, Jenkins, Chef, Docker. It was developed in parallel with the existing (and broken in many ways) infrastructure, so the actual migration of the applications still had to be done. Migrated from broken Zabbix to Prometheus, eliminating a lot of the technical debt. 50\% of my work was maintaining and operating the existing infrastructure.\\[0.7ex]
    \forceindent Why left: my expertise improved significantly, but my salary and working conditions did not

Not everything is in here, only the most important things:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Cloud Platforms: GCP
  \item Cloud Automation: Terraform
  \item Container Orchestration: Kubernetes
  \item CI/CD: Jenkins, GCB, ArgoCD
  \item CMS: Ansible, Chef
  \item Monitoring: Prometheus, Zabbix
  \item Languages: mostly Bash and Python, but I worked some with a dozen different languages over time
\end{itemize}\vspace{2ex}

\textit{Some useless keywords for robots (obviously I worked with this): Linux, Docker, Git, GKE, KVM, Ruby, Groovy}
